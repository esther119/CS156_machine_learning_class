## 8.2 Maximum Margin Learning

## Study Guide

After watching the lecture you should be able to:

- Describe the equation that is used to classify a point, and any special properties of that equation when evaluated on a support vector.
- Give a short derivation of the width of the margin in a linearly-separable maximum margin classifier.

## Pre-class work

### 1. Computational Scaling of SVMs

1. Write a Python function from which you can generate synthetic datasets of an arbitrary size (e.g. a mixture model of two Gaussians).
2. By training SVMs on datasets of different sizes show:
   1. How the training time scales
   2. How the classification time scales (on a sample of 1000 unseen data points)
   3. The accuracy of the classifier (on a sample of 1000 unseen data points)

Choose a kernel that you think is appropriate to the task at hand. Be sure to upload your code yo your personal repository before the class.  Have your results handy for discussion during the class also.
