## Pre-class work

You will discuss your final project in class. Make sure you are ready for this by
- identifying the final project you want to do,
- outlining the steps that your project will require. Usually this will require identifying a problem, an appropriate dataset, a machine learning model, and how to measure the performance of the model. Other projects might entail replicating the results of an existing paper. Feel free to bring a presentation slide to outline your project, and we will display it in class (this is not mandatory, but very much encouraged),
- writing a short paragraph describing your final project.

You will be divided into breakout groups for your final project and will be given time to share ideas. You will be expected to be able to defend your ideas for your final project and highlight which changes you would like to make based on the breakout activities.
