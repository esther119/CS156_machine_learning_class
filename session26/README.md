## 14.2 Synthesis

## Study Guide

After you have finished your review, you should feel comfortable answering the following questions:

- Explain in your own words the similarities and differences between hidden layers in a neural network, the higher-dimensional representation of a linear parameter model, and the kernel trick in an SVM.
- Place the machine learning techniques covered in this class on a scale ranging from "completely non-Bayesian" to "completely Bayesian," and be prepared to explain your choice.

If you feel the answer is not clearly given in the textbook, then you are encouraged to search for alternative sources on the internet.
