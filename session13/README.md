## 7.2 Bayesian Linear Models

## Study Guide

After the reading you should be able to answer the following questions in your own words:

- How is the Bayesian linear model different from a normal linear model trained with ordinary least squares?
- What is the evidence procedure (AKA ML-II, or type two maximum likelihood)?
- What is a hyperparameter?
- How do we make predictions using a Bayesian linear model?

## Pre-class work

[Here](bayesian-regression.ipynb) is a Python notebook with a Bayesian linear model.

**The notebook has some code missing, as well as some questions at the end.**

Download the notebook, fill in the missing code and answer the questions. Upload your working to your pre-class work repository before class. Note that there is a question at the end about frequentist vs Bayesian approaches to statistics, which you may need to read up on to be able to answer. We will discuss this important distinction in class.
